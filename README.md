The jack Player is a Swing based reader for the SRF files used in the YDKJ engines. 
For now, we only support the text and audio resources, but the plan is to ultimately
make the tool recognise the different resource types and it possible to parse questions directly.

Best results come from the question and groove files, as some of the more obscure resource types are not easily represented at the moment.
In addition, the graphic format is currently unknown.

A note that much of the file parsing code behind the scenes to deal with the Mac formats is Copyright &copy; 2009-2011 Rebecca G. Bettencourt / Kreative Software as part of the KSFL library.This code is released under the Mozilla Public license, to match the terms of this library.
